## Feature Components

### 1. Emotional State Definitions

**Woot! State** üòÉ
- **Emotional Context:** High energy, enthusiastic, motivated
- **Use Case:** When feeling energetic and ready for intensive focus work
- **Visual Theme:** Bright, vibrant, energizing imagery and colors

**Meh! State** üòê  
- **Emotional Context:** Neutral energy, steady, balanced
- **Use Case:** Regular work sessions, moderate energy levels
- **Visual Theme:** Balanced, comfortable, non-distracting imagery

**Blah! State** üòû
- **Emotional Context:** Low energy, subdued, needing gentle motivation
- **Use Case:** When feeling tired, overwhelmed, or needing calm focus
- **Visual Theme:** Soothing, calming, supportive imagery

### 2. Emotoji Selector Interface

**Layout Requirements:**
- Three emotojis displayed horizontally
- Positioned near bottom of app interface
- Equal spacing between emotojis
- Clear visual hierarchy without overwhelming timer display

**Interaction Design:**
- Single-selection model (radio button behavior)
- Clear visual indication of selected state
- Smooth hover/touch feedback
- Accessible tap/click targets

**Visual Feedback:**
- **Selected State Indicators:**
  - Border highlight around selected emotoji
  - Subtle glow or shadow effect
  - Color accent matching emotional theme
  - Animation on selection change
- **Unselected States:**
  - Slightly reduced opacity or size
  - Subtle visual indication they are interactive
  - Clear affordance for selection

### 3. State Management

**Selection Logic:**
- Only one emotional state can be active at a time
- Selecting new state immediately deselects previous state
- Visual feedback occurs immediately on selection
- Default state: No emotoji selected (neutral app state)

**State Persistence:**
- Emotional state selection persists during timer session
- State can be changed during active timer without affecting countdown
- State resets to default when app is restarted (intentional design choice)

### 4. Integration with Visual System

**Background Adaptation:**
- Immediate background change upon emotoji selection
- Smooth transitions between background states
- Return to default background when no emotoji selected
- Maintains visual quality across all states

**Color Coordination:**
- Timer and UI elements may adapt accent colors to match emotional theme
- Maintains readability and accessibility across all states
- Subtle coordination without overwhelming the interface

## User Experience Flow

### Initial State
1. User opens app and sees default background
2. No emotoji is selected
3. Timer and controls are in neutral visual state

### Selecting Emotional State
1. User evaluates their current mood/energy level
2. User taps/clicks corresponding emotoji
3. Visual feedback confirms selection immediately
4. Background adapts to match emotional state
5. User proceeds with timer session in supportive visual environment

### Changing States
1. User can change emotional state at any time
2. New selection immediately updates visual environment
3. Timer continues uninterrupted
4. Previous state is automatically deselected

### Clearing Selection
1. User can tap selected emotoji again to deselect (optional behavior)
2. OR selection automatically clears on app restart
3. Returns to default neutral visual state

## Design Principles

### Emotional Intelligence
- Respect different emotional states without judgment
- Provide supportive rather than prescriptive visual feedback
- Acknowledge that productivity looks different across emotional states

### Visual Harmony
- Emotional themes enhance rather than distract from focus
- Smooth transitions prevent jarring visual changes
- Maintain professional appearance suitable for work environments

### Accessibility
- High contrast ratios maintained across all emotional states
- Colorblind-friendly design choices
- Screen reader support for emotoji selection

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Instant visual feedback on selection
- Smooth background transitions (CSS transitions/animations)
- Efficient state management to prevent lag

### Responsive Design
- Emotoji selector adapts to screen sizes
- Touch targets appropriately sized for mobile devices
- Visual feedback scales appropriately

### Integration Points
- Coordinates with background image system
- May influence timer visual theming
- Maintains independence from timer functionality

## Success Criteria
- Users can intuitively select emotional states
- Visual feedback clearly indicates current selection
- Background adaptation enhances rather than distracts from focus
- Emotional states feel meaningful and supportive to users
- Interface remains clean and professional across all states

## Future Considerations
- Analytics on emotional state usage patterns
- Possible correlation tracking between emotional states and session completion
- Additional emotional states based on user feedback
- Personalization of emotional state meanings
