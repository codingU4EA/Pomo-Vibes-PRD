## Technical Requirements

### Image Implementation
**Format and Quality:**
- High-resolution images suitable for various screen sizes
- Optimized file sizes for web performance
- Multiple resolutions for responsive design
- Modern web formats (WebP, with fallbacks)

**Display Properties:**
- Full-screen background coverage
- No tiling or repetition artifacts
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance
- No distortion across different screen sizes
- CSS `background-size: cover` behavior

### Transition System
**Smooth Transitions:**
- Fade transitions between background states (300-500ms duration)
- No jarring or abrupt changes
- Maintain visual continuity during state changes
- Preserve user focus during transitions

**Performance Optimization:**
- Preload background images for smooth transitions
- Efficient memory management for multiple images
- Fast initial load times
- Smooth performance across devices

### Responsive Design
**Multi-Device Support:**
- Optimal display on desktop screens (1920x1080 and larger)
- Tablet optimization (768px-1024px)
- Mobile phone optimization (320px-768px)
- Retina and high-DPI display support

**Adaptive Scaling:**
- Images scale appropriately to screen size
- Maintain visual integrity across resolutions
- Key visual elements remain visible on all screen sizes
- No important content cropped on smaller screens

## Integration Requirements

### State Coordination
**Emotoji Integration:**
- Background changes immediately upon emotoji selection
- Returns to default when no emotoji selected
- Maintains independence from timer functionality
- Consistent state management across app features

**Timer System Compatibility:**
- Backgrounds do not interfere with timer readability
- Sufficient contrast maintained for all text and UI elements
- Visual hierarchy preserved across all background states
- Timer remains primary focus regardless of background

### Accessibility Considerations
**Visual Accessibility:**
- High contrast ratios maintained between text and background
- Support for reduced motion preferences
- Colorblind-friendly design choices
- Screen reader compatibility (alt text, descriptions)

**User Control:**
- Background changes are user-initiated (not automatic)
- Clear visual feedback for current background state
- Ability to return to neutral state easily

## User Experience Design

### Emotional Resonance
**Psychological Impact:**
- Backgrounds support rather than dictate emotional states
- Subtle influence that enhances focus rather than distracts
- Professional appearance suitable for work environments
- Respect for different work styles and preferences

**Visual Harmony:**
- Consistent design language across all background states
- Cohesive color relationships between backgrounds
- Smooth visual flow between different emotional contexts
- Brand consistency maintained across all states

### Performance Experience
**Loading and Responsiveness:**
- Fast initial load times for first-time users
- Instant background changes for returning users
- No lag or delay in emotional state responses
- Smooth performance during active timer sessions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Asset Management
**Image Specifications:**
- Recommended base resolution: 1920x1080 minimum
- Multiple breakpoint variations for responsive design
