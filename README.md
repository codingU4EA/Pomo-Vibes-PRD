# Pomo Vibes - Product Requirements Repository

## About Pomo Vibes

**Pomo Vibes** is an innovative Pomodoro timer application designed to help users "relax into productivity" by integrating emotional awareness with time management. Unlike traditional timers, Pomo Vibes adapts to your current emotional state, providing a personalized and engaging focus experience.

### Key Product Concept

The core innovation of Pomo Vibes lies in its **emotional awareness system**. Users select their current emotional state through intuitive emotoji selection, and the app adapts its visual environment to match and support that emotional state. This creates a more mindful, personalized productivity experience that acknowledges that effective focus looks different depending on how we're feeling.

### Core Features Overview

- 20-minute default Pomodoro sessions with circular progress visualization
- Customizable timer duration through an intuitive settings interface
- Play, pause, and reset controls for flexible session management

üòä **Emotional State Integration** 
- Three distinct emotional states: Woot! (energetic), Meh! (neutral), and Blah! (subdued)
- Visual emotoji selector for quick mood indication
- Adaptive backgrounds that change based on selected emotional state

üé® **Dynamic Visual Environment**
- Custom background imagery for each emotional state
- Smooth transitions between different visual themes
- Responsive design optimized for both mobile and desktop experiences

‚öôÔ∏è **Personalization Options**
- Adjustable timer durations to fit different work styles
- Persistent user preferences across sessions
- Accessible settings interface

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for Pomo Vibes. The PRD is intentionally **technology-agnostic** and designed to be consumed by AI-powered development tools such as:

- Lovable
- Bolt
- Cursor 
- V0
- Other agentic coding platforms

### Documentation Structure

- **[PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md](./PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md)** - Complete PRD with detailed feature specifications
- **README.md** - This overview document
- **Issues** - Individual feature requirements and specifications

### Design Philosophy

The PRD follows these principles:

‚úÖ **Technology Agnostic** - No specific frameworks or technologies prescribed  
‚úÖ **AI-Optimized** - Structured for optimal consumption by coding agents  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive** - Detailed enough for complete implementation  
‚úÖ **User-Centered** - Focused on user experience and emotional well-being  
‚úÖ **Accessible** - Inclusive design considerations throughout  

## Target Implementation

The final Pomo Vibes application should be:

- **Web-based** - Accessible across devices and platforms
- **Responsive** - Seamless experience on mobile and desktop
- **Intuitive** - Minimal learning curve with clear visual hierarchy
- **Engaging** - Visually appealing without being distracting
- **Mindful** - Supportive of different emotional states and energy levels

## Development Workflow

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Review the complete PRD and individual issue specifications
2. **Technology Selection** - Choose appropriate frameworks and tools (not specified in PRD)
3. **Design Implementation** - Create UI/UX that matches the emotional design principles
4. **Feature Development** - Implement features according to acceptance criteria
5. **Testing & Validation** - Ensure all requirements are met and user experience is optimal
